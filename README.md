**project title:**

List of Most Cringe “Inspo” Quotes on WhatsApp Bio's
-


**Project Overview:**

So this is a ridiculous project as specified in the question... I find it extremely hilarious how people put up quotes on their WhatsApp descriptions. So based on the user logging in it would show a list of the top 10 quotes that I find funny or interesting. I think that I can have a pre-determined set of top 10 quotes and every time a user logs in I can randomly pick a set of 10 quotes and go through them in something like a carousel that scrolls every second revealing the quotes from 10(last) to 1(top). The purpose of this website is for people to just get a good laugh.

Some **key features** I think the web-based application includes:

- A webpage with a navbar that includes Home, About, explore, submit and profile that may be limited to log out.
- The main Home page should lead the user to log
- once the user is logged in a start button should be displayed for the web to then display a carousel of top 10 quotes with the countdown
- then the about should display the intention of the platform.
- the explore should allow users to go through a list of quotes present in the memory.
- then last but not least the submit should prompt the user to submit a interesting quote that they came across so it can be added to the list once reviewed by me.
- Also the carousel should allow the user to go forward backwards.

**Tech Stack:** For this project I would like to use a vite app that runs on react js. I would also like to install and use other libraries and frameworks that include chakra UI, Material Ui, Tailwind CSS, react-icon library, react-router-dom and so on. I will use MongoDB and express for the backend. I will also use VS code and stackblitz to write my code.

**Why This Project:** I have no particular intention for choosing specifically this. I had multiple other ideas including "wierdest way people eat maggi", "list of pets that look like they can dominate the world", "funniest spelling mistakes shops or vendors make" and so on but I liked this idea the most as I can relate to it pretty well and its a simple enough project to make me confident to say that I can implement it by myself.

**Created à Landing page** I have split the frontend and backend into two different folders and installed vite in the frontend. I also made a new page called landing.jsx where I have added a small overview about the project. The landing.jsx is rendered through app.jsx to the main page.
