        <h1>Cringe Whatsapp quotes!</h1>
        <p>
            So this is a ridiculous project as specified in the question... I find it extremely hilarious how people put up quotes on their WhatsApp descriptions. So based on the user logging in it would show a list of the top 10 quotes that I find funny or interesting. I think that I can have a pre-determined set of top 10 quotes and every time a user logs in I can randomly pick a set of 10 quotes and go through them in something like a carousel that scrolls every second revealing the quotes from 10(last) to 1(top). The purpose of this website is for people to just get a good laugh.
